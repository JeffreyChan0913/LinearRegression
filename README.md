# LinearRegression
This is a basic introduction Linear Regression materials. 

Text Book

I am using Applied Linear Statistical Models Fifth Edition by Michael H Kutner, Christopher J. Nachtsheim, John Neter, and William Li

Text Book might be found online, but I strongly suggest you to get the book on amazon, because some important information are missing like the appendix portion which contains a lot of proofs.

All the materials are used from this book. Otherwise, it will be cited. 

Before you start going thru the materials, you should know some basic calculus, like derivative, partial derivative, MLE, sufficient statistics. In short, you need to know statistics II or PSTAT 120B from UCSB or equivalent. 

It has 2 parts. Chapter note, and chapter review. Review will lay out the things that I believe that is very important and a must know concepts or formulas. 

Might go thru the materials on my Youtube Channel if time allows. 

Please email me if you have any questions.
