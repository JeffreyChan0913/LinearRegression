# LinearRegression
This is a basic introduction Linear Regression materials. 

I am using Applied Linear Statistical Models Fifth Edition by Michael H Kutner, Christopher J. Nachtsheim, John Neter, and William Li

All the materials are used from this book. Otherwise, it will be cited. 

It has 2 part. Chapter notes, and chapter review. Review will lay out the things that I believe that is very important and a must know concepts or formulas. 

Might go thru the materials on my Youtube Channel if time allows. 

Please email me if you have any questions.
